 <h1>REACT-SOCIAL-MEDIA-APP</h1>

 <h3>Getting Started with Create React App</h3>


<p> Using the React library, I coded a social media interface with a very detailed component structure.
In this project, the props structure of React.js and react icon libraries were used in a very professional manner.
In the later stages of the project, I plan to turn it into a site structure where people can log in to their social media accounts, view their profiles and share with a login interface.</p>
